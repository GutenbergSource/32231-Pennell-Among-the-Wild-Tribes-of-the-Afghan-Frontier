 The text of this copy has been prepared from a the second edition (1909) scanned by Google. However, the illustrations, including the title page and cover image, have been taken from the 1922 edition available at The Internet Archive. Illustrations not available in that edition, have been copied from the serialized Dutch translation of this book (reduced to about one third of the text), already present in Project Gutenberg.
